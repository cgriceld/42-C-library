# libft

The aim of the project was to recode some C standard library functions as well as write other useful one.\
Using this library, you can do some memory, types, strings and linked lists manipulations.\
Each function has brief description.

To compile library except linked list functions (those that start with `ft_lst...`) run `make`.\
To compile all functions run `make bonus`.\
To delete only object files (`*.o`) run `clean`. To delete object files and library file (`libft.a`) run `fclean`.\
To delete both object and library files and recompile run `re`.
